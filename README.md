# Spam-Vs-Ham-Classifier
Spam : "Irrelevant or unsolicited messages sent over the Internet, typically to a large number of users, for the purposes of advertising, phishing, spreading malware etc."

Ham : "Ham refers to messages that are generally not spam. Even if they seem to appear as unnecessary, we would have consented to such mails being sent at a certain point of time."

I have used a Na√Øve Bayes Classifier to classify the data as spam / ham.
